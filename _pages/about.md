I am a Computer Science graduate with a strong passion for data-driven insights and political analysis. Combining my technical background with a keen interest in socio-political dynamics, I specialize in using computational methods to explore trends, predict outcomes, and understand the deeper narratives behind political behavior. Whether itâ€™s through data visualization, sentiment analysis, or social network modeling, I strive to bridge the gap between technology and political understanding. I believe that informed, algorithmically enhanced analysis can contribute to a more transparent and accountable public discourse.
